Please update the Dovecote Estate site with the following copy, layout, design, and functionality improvements.

🔹 Global Design & Functionality

Typography hierarchy

H1 → text-5xl md:text-6xl leading-tight

H2 → text-3xl md:text-4xl

H3 → text-xl md:text-2xl

Body → text-lg text-gray-700

Fonts: Use Prata (sleek serif) for headings and Inter for body. This removes the western vibe and feels high-end/modern.

Buttons unified everywhere (hero, lots, packages, contact):

Primary: rounded-2xl px-5 py-3 text-sm font-medium bg-forest-green text-white shadow hover:opacity-95 transition

Secondary: rounded-2xl px-5 py-3 text-sm font-medium border border-forest-green text-forest-green bg-white hover:bg-forest-green/5 transition

Hero polish:

Lock aspect ratio (aspect-[16/9] desktop, aspect-[4/5] mobile).

Apply object-cover and add subtle dark overlay for text readability.

Add preload: <link rel="preload" as="image" href="/assets/hero.jpg" />

Navigation:

Add scroll offset so section anchors don’t hide under nav bar:

const scrollToSection = (id: string) => {
  const el = document.querySelector(id);
  if (!el) return;
  const y = (el as HTMLElement).getBoundingClientRect().top + window.scrollY - 80;
  window.scrollTo({ top: y, behavior: "smooth" });
  setIsMenuOpen(false); 
};


Ensure mobile menu closes after click/route change.

Add /packages link to desktop nav.

Gallery & Lifestyle images:

Use consistent ratios (aspect-square or aspect-[4/3]).

Lazy-load below fold.

Always set width/height to prevent layout shift.

Footer:

Add /privacy + /terms.

Include ABN, copyright, and disclaimer (“Imagery is indicative only. Subject to council approval.”).

🔹 Homepage Section Order & Copy
Section 1 – Hero / Headline

Headline: “Stanley, a Harbour of Heritage and Growth”

Subhead: “Discover your perfect coastal sanctuary in Stanley's most exclusive residential subdivision.”

CTA: “View Available Lots” → scroll to Lots section.

Section 2 – A Once in a Lifetime Opportunity

Headline: “A Once in a Lifetime Opportunity” (remove hyphens from subhead)

Add subhead: “Development Ready”

Keep icons here (moved from old “Development Ready” section):

Full Infrastructure – Connected to sewerage, power & stormwater.

Premium Location – Walking distance to beaches, cafés & attractions.

NBN Ready – High-speed internet connectivity.

Quality Roads – Sealed entrances with footpaths.

Section 3 – Available Lots

Keep interactive grid.

Add skeleton loader (3–6 gray cards) while data loads.

On error, show:
“Lots are being updated. Please check back shortly or [enquire now] for a current schedule.”

Section 4 – JDR Home & Land Packages

Move directly under Available Lots.

Intro line above: “Prefer turnkey? Explore architecturally designed homes paired with premium lots.”

Keep all existing JDR listings, floor plans, features, and imagery.

Section 5 – Stanley Marina

Rename section (old “The Marina Factor”) → “Stanley Marina”

Copy (rewrite for premium tone):
“A proposed marina could redefine Stanley’s future. If realised, it would attract yachts, recreational boats, and cruise visitors — anchoring Stanley as a premier coastal destination. Beyond lifestyle benefits, it would generate tourism, jobs, and long-term capital growth.”

Add FAQ accordion:

When will it be approved? → “Currently in planning; updates will be shared as the process develops.”

How could it impact property values? → “Historically, marina precincts create strong demand and uplift surrounding land values.”

What are the lifestyle benefits? → “Enhanced tourism, marine culture, and access to water-based recreation.”

Use provided marina imagery prominently in this section.

Section 6 – The Stanley Lifestyle

Headline: “The Stanley Lifestyle”

Subheads (all white for readability):

Godfrey’s Beach

The Nut State Reserve

Stanley Golf Club

Cradle Mountain

Gateway to Adventure

Supporting copy in text-lg text-gray-600.

Use consistent aspect ratios for lifestyle images.

🔹 Deleted / Merged Sections

Remove separate “Development Ready” and “Location Highlights” sections (content already integrated).

✅ Acceptance Criteria

Flow is: Hero → Opportunity → Lots → Packages → Marina → Lifestyle.

Headline/subheads always readable (contrast fixed).

Logo font = Prata (premium serif).

Buttons unified across site.

Marina imagery + FAQ accordion included.

Lifestyle subheads in white.

Footer has ABN, legal links, and disclaimer.

Performance polish: preload hero, lazy-load galleries, consistent ratios.
