Create Full Clean ZIP for Expert Optimisation, SEO, & PR Copy Review

You are preparing the Dovecote Estate website for a full expert optimisation and professional SEO refinement.
The goal is to produce one clean, downloadable ZIP that includes everything needed for:

Advanced front-end performance and design review

Back-end (Express + Drizzle + Neon) structure and database efficiency audit

SEO + structured data optimisation (schema, meta, OG/Twitter)

Google Lighthouse/Core Web Vitals improvement plan (target 95 +)

Creation of a press-release-style SEO content block for editorial backlinks and PR distribution

Follow these steps exactly.

🧹 Step 1 – Clean unnecessary build files

Remove all generated, cache, and dependency folders while keeping your working code.

rm -rf node_modules dist .replit replit.nix .cache .vercel .next .turbo .pnpm-store

📁 Step 2 – Ensure essential directories exist
mkdir -p src public server shared attached_assets drizzle

📦 Step 3 – Create consolidated project ZIP

Bundle only what’s necessary for review:

zip -r dovecote-estate-full.zip \
src \
public \
server \
shared \
attached_assets \
drizzle \
package.json \
tsconfig.json \
vite.config.* \
drizzle.config.* \
index.html \
tailwind.config.* \
postcss.config.* \
README.md \
.env.example \
.env


(Keep .env only if it contains placeholder values — redact sensitive keys.)

🗄️ Step 4 – Include Drizzle migrations/schema
zip -ur dovecote-estate-full.zip drizzle/*.sql drizzle/*.json drizzle/*.ts

✅ Step 5 – Verify
ls -lh dovecote-estate-full.zip


Ensure file size < 50 MB and that node_modules and dist were not re-added.

🏁 Step 6 – Confirm

Reply:

✅ Dovecote Estate export complete — dovecote-estate-full.zip ready for expert world-class optimisation, Lighthouse audit, and PR-SEO content creation.

💎 Step 7 – Purpose of Export

This archive will allow an expert to:

Optimise React/Vite performance, lazy loading, and caching

Audit Express + Drizzle + Neon data handling

Refine meta, schema, and Open Graph for SEO & shareability

Tune accessibility and heading hierarchy

Implement compression and CDN-level caching

Optimise Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID/INP < 2.5 s / 0.1 / 100 ms)

Prepare a press-release-quality content block for distribution to major property and lifestyle media

📈 Step 8 – Keyword & SEO Framework

Use naturally across headings, meta, and alt text:

Primary:
Stanley Tasmania real estate, coastal land for sale Tasmania, house and land packages Stanley, Dovecote Estate Stanley, premium coastal subdivision Tasmania

Secondary:
Tasmanian property growth, Stanley coastal investment, North West Tasmania lifestyle, ocean view land Tasmania, residential lots near The Nut

Emotional / Brand:

🧭 Step 9 – Recommended meta block

Add (or confirm) in <head> of index.html:

<meta name="keywords" content="Stanley Tasmania real estate, coastal land for sale Tasmania, house and land packages Stanley, Dovecote Estate, Tasmanian property growth, coastal subdivision Tasmania, premium coastal living, Stanley coastal investment">
<meta name="author" content="Dovecote Estate">
<meta property="og:title" content="Dovecote Estate — Premium Coastal Land & House Packages in Stanley, Tasmania">
<meta property="og:description" content="Discover Stanley’s premier coastal subdivision offering residential land and house & land packages with ocean views, heritage charm, and future growth potential.">

⚙️ Step 10 – Lighthouse / Core Web Vitals Target
Metric	Goal	Optimisation Focus
LCP	< 2.5 s	Preload hero image, compress large assets
CLS	< 0.1	Fixed image heights & consistent spacing
INP/FID	< 100 ms	Lazy-load non-critical scripts & components
Accessibility	> 95	ARIA labels, alt text, contrast checks
Performance / SEO	> 95	Code-split, cache headers, semantic HTML
📰 Step 11 – Press-Release Style SEO Content (for backlinks)

After export, the expert will create a 250–300 word press-release block optimised for Domain, realestate.com.au, and Tasmanian Business Review with the following structure:

Headline: e.g. “Dovecote Estate Brings Premium Coastal Living to Tasmania’s North-West”

Lead paragraph: investment & lifestyle hook with keywords

Body: details on land release, growth potential, and Stanley’s heritage charm

CTA: drive traffic to dovecoteestate.com.au

This content will be SEO-tuned for both news backlinking and Google Discover visibility.
