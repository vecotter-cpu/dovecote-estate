Prompt: Fix footer alignment & spacing

Please tidy the footer so all elements align to the same grid and baseline.

Layout & grid

Use a 3-column grid inside the footer container with equal column widths on desktop:
grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 gap-8 md:gap-12 max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8

Column 1 = Logo + tagline + socials
Column 2 = Quick Links (two-column list)
Column 3 = Contact

Ensure the left padding matches the site’s main content container so the footer logo aligns vertically with the header logo.

Column alignment

Top-align all three columns (no vertical drift).

Set consistent heading styles for “Quick Links” and “Contact” (same font-size/weight/margin). Example:
text-base font-semibold tracking-tight mb-4

Convert Quick Links to a two-column list on desktop:
grid grid-cols-2 gap-x-8 gap-y-2

Logo block (Column 1)

Keep reduced logo size (≈50–60% of previous).

Left-align the logo with the content grid; remove any extra left margin that pushes it inward.

Tagline width should not exceed 32ch; apply: max-w-prose text-gray-300 mt-4.

Social icons row: consistent 16px icons, equal gaps (flex gap-4 mt-4 items-center), vertically centered.

Vertical rhythm

Use consistent section spacing:

Between logo → tagline → socials: mt-4 each.

Between links and legal bar: mt-10 md:mt-12.

Divider & legal bar

The thin divider should span the same max-width as the grid and align with its left edge:
<hr class="mt-10 border-white/10 max-w-7xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8" />

Legal row (copyright, ABN, disclaimer) centered, small and readable:
text-xs text-white/60 text-center mt-4 space-y-1

Ensure the divider and legal row line up with the grid (no extra offsets).

Responsive

On mobile: stack columns (Logo → Links → Contact) with gap-8, keep left alignment, and maintain readable tap targets.

Do not change

Copy, links, phone/email, ABN, or colors—only alignment, spacing, and layout.

Acceptance

Footer logo left-aligned to the same vertical grid line as the header logo.

Three columns top-aligned and visually balanced.

Quick Links display in two neat columns on desktop, single column on mobile.

Divider and legal text align perfectly with the content grid.
